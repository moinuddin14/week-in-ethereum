Governance and Standards

Eric Conner: a case for Ethereum block reward reduction. There’s an Etherchain coinvote (hardly perfect, must use MyCrypto/MEW) on the subject where 50k ETH has vote nearly unanimously to decrease block rewards to miners. There’s also proposal variations like 1276 (delete bomb, 2 ETH) and 1277 (2 ETH). There’s wide support for issuance reduction, the question is about magnitude of reduction, how long should the bomb be delayed, and should an anti-ASIC measure be included.
